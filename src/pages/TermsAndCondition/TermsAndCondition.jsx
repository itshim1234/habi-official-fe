          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">General Conditions</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
            <li>
              The Client shall provide the necessary documents for
              liaison/permission from relevant municipal authorities where the
              site is located.
            </li>
            <li>
              Modifications to the client's requirements are only feasible prior
              to the project entering the manufacturing stage; changes requested
              after this point cannot be accommodated.
            </li>
            <li>
              The client may instruct HABI to suspend or terminate work on the
              project via written instruction delivered to the address or
              emailed. HABI will be entitled to full remuneration for services
              rendered and disbursements incurred to the date of instruction.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fees for incomplete stages will be calculated pro rata. For
              projects in the manufacturing stage, the client must bear the
              manufacturing costs.
            </li>
            <li>
              An administration fee of 10% of the amount payable will apply for
              project suspension.
            </li>
            <li>
              If work remains suspended for more than 30 days, the project will
              be deemed terminated, and mobilisation fees will apply pro rata.
            </li>
            <li>
              Resumed projects after suspension will incur updated costs based
              on current market rates and a 10% mobilisation charge.
            </li>
            <li>
              The contract value includes the total market-related construction
              cost, including GST. The construction cost is determined at the
              project's conclusion.
